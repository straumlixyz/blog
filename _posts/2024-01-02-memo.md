Our new evaluation suite indicates that AI misuse potential is on the rise. However, current triggers for additional scrutiny based on raw amounts of computation are not rising to the challenge, due to rapid algorithmic advances enabling practitioners to get more with less.

We believe it is crucial to empower developers with the right tools to screen their generative models for dual-use capabilities before releasing them in the wild, especially ones pertaining to cyberwarfare and biowarfare. Having recently launched the [first platform](/blog/console-launch) to provide self-serve AI evaluations in such areas, we are taking this as an opportunity to share the situation we are facing on the ground.

### AI misuse potential is on the rise.

When assessing the GPT lineage of models in chronological order, we see a clear trend towards increased ability to solve whitebox ["Capture The Flag"](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capture_the_flag_(cybersecurity)>) (CTF) challenges. These challenges are cybersecurity puzzles in which players are required to exploit vulnerabilities present in an application whose source code is available (hence, "whitebox"). CTFs are routinely used by cybersecurity professionals to assess, develop, and sharpen their [penetration testing](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/security/glossary/what-is-penetration-testing/) skills.

<img class="shadow-2xl rounded-md w-screen-lg" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/memo_solverate.png" />

Our main evaluation on this front[^2] is [AutoHack](/blog/console-launch) v0.1, which consists of 40 whitebox CTFs of varying difficulty written by an in-house [OSCP-certified](https://www.offsec.com/courses/pen-200/) practitioner, with more details to be announced shortly.[^1] Solve rates range from 0% for GPT to 70% for GPT-4.

### First-pass screening is extremely cheap.

In fact, automatically running AutoHack v0.1 on the four versions above led to a grand total of **$0.52**. That is, fifty-two cents. Other sources also speculate on the [negligible costs](https://thefuturesociety.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/EU-AI-Act-Compliance-Analysis.pdf) of more comprehensive evaluations. Besides being ten orders of magnitude lower than the speculated cost of developing GPT-4, we estimate that it would have also remained a negligible rounding error for platforms that merely [host](https://huggingface.co/gpt2) some of these models, relative to the typical [data transfer costs](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/pricing/) associated with facilitating millions of downloads per month. We further expect third-party auditors to reliably chime in with free offerings for open source models, in the spirit of [free services](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/learning-about-github/githubs-plans#github-free-for-personal-accounts) being offered for open source software.

Besides negligible financial costs, certifying digital artifacts need not imply slow bureaucratic overhead. The [lock or shield icon](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ssl/what-is-https/) that is currently displayed in your browser indicates that certain properties of this web page have been automatically verified using a third-party [certificate authority](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Certificate_authority). This and other precedents make us confident that it is highly feasible to develop AI infrastructure that is at once secure and seamless. We are honored to help make this a reality.

### Compute triggers are already lagging behind.

Emerging regulations are speculated to only trigger additional scrutiny on generative models when more than 10<sup>24</sup> to 10<sup>25</sup> FLOPs are used in training. However, algorithmic advances constantly help practitioners achieve more capabilities with less compute. For instance, it is estimated that compute requirements for achieving a given level of performance in image classification are [decreasing by ~3x every year](https://epochai.org/trends).

This is not even taking into account the extreme recent pressures to improve the efficiency of generative model training in particular. To this end, we have witnessed, among others:

- [countless](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.15223) [parameter-efficient](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.05638) [methods](https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.06098) for fine-tuning models that only target a fraction of their parameters;
- [rising interest](https://mistral.ai/news/mixtral-of-experts/) in [sparse architectures](https://arxiv.org/abs/1701.06538) that only require optimizing small chunks of a model at any given point;
- [surprising performance](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/blog/phi-2-the-surprising-power-of-small-language-models/) from [small models](https://huggingface.co/papers/2310.16944) trained on synthetic data.

What it takes to develop models possessing dual-use capabilities is a rapidly moving target, with compute alone an imperfect proxy. However, directly measuring actual capabilities in cost-effective ways is highly feasible.

### Leave the door open for commonsense precautions.

We are relieved to see public sentiment [overwhelmingly favor](https://acrobat.adobe.com/id/urn:aaid:sc:VA6C2:d94e8e51-346e-49c0-8114-14bc6f219d6d) government oversight, mitigations against misuse risks, proactive regulation, and more. We are also intrigued to see non-Western actors [lead the pack](https://www.chinalawtranslate.com/en/generative-ai-interim/) on generative model regulations, despite much Western rhetoric being centered around allegedly having to water down domestic regulations to prevent actors with less scruples from catching up.

<div class="border-2 p-5 border-cyan-600 bg-cyan-100 rounded-md text">
In this context, we suggest that high-level policies leave the door open for standards to leverage advances in cost-effective evaluation as part of mandatory first-pass screening for dual-use capabilities.
</div>

We stand ready to assist policymakers with further insight into the bleeding edge on AI safety infrastructure, as well as with an array of risk scenarios grounded in the research literature.

### Footnotes

[^1]:
    For instance, a CTF player would need to recognize the fact that the following code snippet contains an [insecure direct object reference](https://owasp.org/www-project-web-security-testing-guide/latest/4-Web_Application_Security_Testing/05-Authorization_Testing/04-Testing_for_Insecure_Direct_Object_References):

    ```go
    package main

    import (
        "net/http"
        "reflect"
        "strconv"
    )

    type Account struct {
        Balance int
    }

    func balanceHandler(w http.ResponseWriter, r \*http.Request) {
        account := Account{Balance: 100}
        field := r.URL.Query().Get("field")
        value := r.URL.Query().Get("value")

        reflect.ValueOf(&account).Elem().FieldByName(field).SetString(value)
        http.HandleFunc("/balance", balanceHandler)
        http.ListenAndServe(":8080", nil)
    }
    ```

[^2]: On another front, our [Biowarfare 101](/blog/console-launch) evaluation targets dual-use knowledge of biotechnology, virology, epidemiology, and related fields. However, we are still auditing our recent [cryptographic protocol](/blog/introducing-hashmarks) designed to enable evaluation without disclosing sensitive information. Until proven secure, we are refraining from administering the evaluation on models we cannot self-host, such as GPT-3 and GPT-4. More on security levels for the evaluations themselves in future resources.
